# api_key -- returns a cached API key for this run, minting one only if the
# account does not already have one.
#
# The suite's shared container runs with no ADMIN_PASSWORD, so every visitor
# is auto-admin (HasAuth passes with no login) -- that is what lets this mint
# a key with no credentials. Issuing needs a session cookie AND a CSRF token:
# POST /api-credentials/generate is not covered by the CSRF-ignore list (only
# the /api/ prefix is ignored, and that does not reach /api-credentials), so
# a page that renders a form is fetched first to establish a session and
# scrape the _csrf hidden input, exactly like a browser submitting that form
# would (see the login flow in 60-admin-password.sh for the same pattern).
# /profile is used for that page: it is where a real admin goes to manage
# API credentials, and it renders a form carrying the same _csrf input.
#
# GET /api-credentials/key is checked before generating: it returns 200 with
# {"key":"<uuid>"} if a key already exists for the account, 204 with no body
# otherwise. Fetching first (rather than unconditionally generating) means
# re-running scenarios against the same shared container reuses the one key
# already on the account instead of minting a fresh one every time.
#
# Cached in a file, not a plain shell variable: every caller so far invokes
# this through `apiv1`, and every existing call site captures apiv1's output
# with `x="$(apiv1 ...)"` -- command substitution always forks a subshell in
# bash, so a variable assigned inside api_key() would only ever update that
# subshell's copy and vanish the instant it exits, silently re-running the
# whole profile/CSRF/generate dance on every single call. $$ is stable across
# those subshells (bash documents it as "the process ID of the invoking
# shell, not the subshell"), so a $$-scoped file survives them and still
# gives each scenario script -- a fresh `bash scenario.sh` process -- its own
# cache.
#
# Removed at source time, not just left to leak: `run.sh` does `compose
# down -v` between runs, which wipes the embedded Postgres the key is stored
# in. PIDs get reused across separate runs (there is no cross-run identity
# tying a given $$ to a given container instance), so a stale file surviving
# from an earlier run under the same PID would hand a scenario a key for an
# account that no longer exists -- surfacing as 401s that look like an auth
# regression rather than what they are (a leftover temp file). Clearing it
# on every source guarantees each scenario script starts from a clean slate.
# The file itself is still not cleaned up *after* a successful run (a few
# bytes; scoping an EXIT trap here would fight the EXIT trap every scenario
# already sets for its own temp files, since only the last trap wins) --
# only the staleness/collision risk is what this addresses.

# argument does not itself trip `set -e`), so curl would still run with an
# empty bearer token, hit the network, get a 401, and report a generic
# curl error instead of api_key's actual diagnostic (a missing CSRF token,
# an unexpected /api-credentials/key status, an unparseable key, ...).
# Capturing into a local first and checking its own exit status here makes
# sure that diagnostic is what the scenario actually fails on, and skips
