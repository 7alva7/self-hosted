# idle sleep exactly the same as for a live versitygw. Only actually talking
# to the endpoint tells the two apart.

# Driven via `docker exec` (webtor_exec) rather than publishing 8099 in
# tests/docker-compose.yml: the endpoint is bound to 127.0.0.1 inside the
# container and deliberately not proxied by nginx or published anywhere in
# production (see s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/s3/run) -- it has no auth of its own
# beyond the generated key/secret, so publishing it would test a topology
# that does not exist in production. The container's own curl (Alpine
# 3.22, curl 8.14.1) supports --aws-sigv4, so no host-only tooling is
# needed to sign the request.
