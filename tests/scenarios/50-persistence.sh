# State survives a container restart (`docker compose restart`, same
# container -- not a full recreate/replace): the resource stays registered,
# the listing is unchanged, and the downloaded bytes are still exactly the
# fixture's, not just "some front page returned 200".
#
# What this actually proves, and what it doesn't: probing the running
# baseline image (see task-7-report.md for the full transcript) shows that
# postgres data under /pgdata and downloaded torrent content under /data are
# genuinely volume-backed -- they survive a full container recreate, not just
# a restart. But the resource *registration* itself (torrent-http-proxy's
# badger provider, which backs GET /resource/<id> and the listing) lives at
# /tmp/badger in this image, which is NOT on either named volume. It survives
# `docker compose restart` only because that command keeps the same
# container's writable layer intact; a full recreate (`down`/`up`, or a pod
# reschedule in k8s) loses it even with both volumes fully retained -- this
# was verified directly, see the negative control in the report. So this
# scenario proves crash-restart-in-place survival (postgres recovery +
# resource/content integrity), not durable-volume-backed resource state
# across pod replacement -- that distinction matters for the version jump
# this suite gates and is called out explicitly rather than implied.
