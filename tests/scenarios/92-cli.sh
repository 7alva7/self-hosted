# webtor-cli -- the official command-line client -- against a self-hosted
# instance, using the exact config-less mode a CI pipeline or a curious
# self-hoster would reach for first: WEBTOR_BACKEND=webui plus
# WEBTOR_BASE_URL/WEBTOR_API_KEY in the environment, no config file, no
# keyring (internal/config/config.go:141-155 in the webtor-cli repo --
# Resolve() returns straight from the env branch and never calls Load or
# the keyring at all when WEBTOR_BACKEND is set, so WEBTOR_NO_KEYRING=1 is
# not actually load-bearing on this path; it is set anyway as cheap
# insurance against ever touching a keyring/D-Bus inside the throwaway
# container, and to keep this scenario correct if that early-return ever
# changes).
#
# The CLI runs as the *published* image, pinned by tag+digest the same way
# every component in this repo's own Dockerfile is pinned -- testing a
# locally built binary would prove nothing about what self-hosters actually
# get. This digest is NOT watched by Renovate: renovate.json's docker
# manager only scans Dockerfile-shaped FROM lines and compose "image:"
# fields (there is no regexManagers/customManagers section here), and this
# pin lives in a plain shell variable inside a test script, a file type
# Renovate's default docker manager does not look at -- even though the
# packageName would match the "ghcr.io/webtor-io/**" rule if it were ever
# seen. Bumping it is manual, the same way versitygw's pin in the Dockerfile
# already is (see that file's own comment).
#
# The CLI runs in its own throwaway container on the compose network,
# addressing the instance under test by its compose service name (webtor)
# on its container-internal port (8080) -- not the host-published port --
# because the point is proving the CLI can reach a self-hosted box as a
# separate machine would, the same way webseed already does for
# torrent-web-seeder in the other scenarios.
#
# Re-runnable against a warm container: `add` is content-addressed and
# idempotent (api-sdk-go resource.go's own doc comment; 20-archive.sh
# already relies on the same POST /resource being safe to repeat), so a
# second run just gets back the same resource id and creates no new state
# to clean up -- unlike 80-vault.sh's pledge or 91-s3-webui.sh's library
# row, there is nothing here that needs an EXIT trap.
